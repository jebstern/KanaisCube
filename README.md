# KanaisCube / Manager for Kanai's Cube

"Manager for Kanais Cube" makes it easy for you to see which Diablo 3 items you have cubed (extracted legendary power) and which items you haven't.
You can choose between Season or Normal mode, and you can follow your progress along the way.

In settings, you can choose to display only all, cubed or non-cubed items. You can also choose to display only armor, weapons or jewelry items.
